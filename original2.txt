The interview is part of an oral history project on Cambodian American culture, conducted with Emma’s father, Parady Soch, a Khmer Rouge survivor.
The conversation was both challenging and informative, providing deep insights into the traumatic past that has shaped his life and the broader Cambodian American experience.
Mr. Soch, born and raised in Phnom Penh, experienced a drastic upheaval in his life when the Khmer Rouge dictatorship took over.
His early life, full of education and dreams, was violently interrupted by the atrocities committed during the regime.
The interview revealed the lasting effects of loss, trauma, and war, as well as the struggles of adapting to life as an immigrant in America.
His story illuminated the enduring consequences of displacement and survival, offering a personal perspective on historical events.
One of the most poignant parts of the interview was Mr. Soch's account of his father’s disappearance during the regime.
He described how his family was split apart after the seizure of Phnom Penh.
His father, a devoted family man and government worker, volunteered to return to the city, thinking he would be helping with the situation.
Tragically, this decision led to his disappearance.
Weeks later, the family received a letter from Mr. Soch's father, warning them not to return to the city as it was a trap.
This letter reflected the desperation and fear, hinting at his father’s likely execution.
The interview further delved into Mr. Soch's experiences of surviving the Khmer Rouge’s oppressive regime.
He recounted how families stayed close to avoid separation, highlighting the fear and survival instincts ingrained during this time.
His three-year stay in a refugee camp after escaping Phnom Penh underscored the long-lasting suffering endured by many Cambodians.
Despite these hardships, Mr. Soch's endurance and ability to survive such traumatic experiences are testaments to human resilience.
The experience of conducting the interview was also a significant learning moment.
The group made efforts to ensure Mr. Soch felt comfortable, such as turning off cameras during the Zoom call.
Technical difficulties aside, the interview was a success, and efforts were made to end the conversation on a lighter note, with questions about Mr. Soch's life in America, such as the car he owned.
In addition to his harrowing experiences under the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Soch's reflections on life in the United States were illuminating.
He spoke of the culture shock he experienced, from the prevalence of cars to the absence of uniforms in American schools.
Yet, despite these differences, he has maintained his cultural heritage by celebrating Cambodian traditions like the New Year and speaking Khmer with his children.
This interview provided not only a personal connection to the historical events studied in class but also a deeper understanding of the immigrant experience, resilience, and the importance of cultural preservation.
Mr. Soch’s determination to maintain his Cambodian identity despite the hardships of adjusting to life in America mirrors the broader struggles many immigrants face when navigating new cultural environments.
