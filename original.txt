The transcript is an interview conducted as part of an oral history project on Cambodian American culture.
The primary speaker being interviewed is a Khmer Rouge survivor, recounting his experiences in Cambodia during the regime and his subsequent migration to the United States.
The interview begins with an introduction by the interviewer, who is the survivor's daughter, setting the context of the oral history project.
The interviewee shares details about his family, including his name and its origins, before moving into the trauma experienced during the Khmer Rouge regime.
He explains that many of his siblings, especially step-siblings, were killed, with only one surviving sibling still living in Cambodia.
He briefly touches upon the early life in Cambodia, which focused on education and limited activities, contrasting it with the more activity-rich American childhood.
The interview transitions to the moment of the Khmer Rouge takeover, described as a sudden and chaotic event.
On April 17, the sound of gunfire and bombings marked the regime's announcement of "liberation."
The Khmer Rouge instructed the citizens to leave Phnom Penh temporarily, supposedly for three days, as they falsely claimed the U.S. would bomb the city.
The speaker recalls gathering weapons from his father, a general in the Cambodian army, as part of the regime's demand to disarm the public.
However, this temporary evacuation turned into a long, harrowing journey away from their home, during which the interviewee, then 13 years old, witnessed widespread death and destruction.
His journey led to a refugee camp at the Cambodian-Thai border, where he and his family faced further hardship.
He explains how survival during this period meant constant movement to avoid conflicts and a struggle for food.
Despite surviving multiple brushes with death, including being forced into labor camps and being interrogated multiple times, the interviewee survived by passing tests of his identity.
He highlights how important it was to hide his background, as revealing his father’s military status would have led to his immediate execution.
The interview also delves into life after the Khmer Rouge regime.
He recounts being part of the Khmer Sarai rebel group, mostly for survival, where he experienced occasional combat.
However, he clarifies that the group mainly served a protective role along the border, rather than engaging in frequent battles.
The speaker shares his initial impressions of the United States after arriving as a refugee.
He was struck by the prevalence of cars and the absence of uniforms in schools, which differed from the uniformed, motorbike-reliant Cambodia.
He talks about his transition into American society, mentioning how he learned English quickly due to his early education in Cambodia, where English was taught in a special school due to his father’s connections with the U.S. government.
Towards the end of the interview, the focus shifts to preserving Cambodian culture.
The interviewee emphasizes the importance of Cambodian New Year and Pchum Ben, a traditional festival to honor ancestors.
He also reflects on how the hardships of his past shaped the way he raised his children, highlighting the importance of passing cultural traditions to future generations.
Finally, the interviewee shares his thoughts on the current political climate in Cambodia, expressing dismay over its shift towards dictatorship and ongoing human rights violations, which have prevented him from returning to his homeland.
